You are designing a Trello-style board interface with a clean, minimal, yet powerful look and feel. Don’t implement collaboration logic—just build the UI scaffolding so it’s ready to integrate features via the Velt SDK later.## UI Requirements### 1. Layout & Navigation- A responsive top navbar that includes: - User switcher dropdown: shows current user’s avatar/name; dropdown lists available user identities. - Dark / Light mode toggle with smooth transition. - Board title and optional “Add List” button.### 2. Board & Lists- Boards contain vertical lists (columns).- Each list includes: - Title (editable). - Options menu (⋯). - “Add Card” button.### 3. Cards- Cards display: - Title text. - Optional avatar icons for the assigned users. - Reactions area underneath card title (just UI placeholders like 👍, ❤️, 🎉). - “Comment count” badge placeholder.- Cards are draggable between lists (UI only; no drag logic).### 4. Comments & Reactions- Inline comment UI on the card detail pane: - Text area for “Add a comment…” - List of comments, each showing user avatar/name, timestamp, and text. - Reactions toolbar next to each comment (UI only).- On card previews: show comment count and reaction count badges.### 5. Real-Time Presence Indicators- In the navbar or top-right: placeholder UI showing colored dot avatars representing “currently online” users (use mock images).### 6. Theme Support- Full Light and Dark mode styling.- Include a toggle switch that seamlessly swaps variables/colors.### 7. Minimal & Effective Design- Use clean typography, intuitive spacing.- Components should feel lightweight and polished.- Avoid visual clutter—focus on clarity and usability.## Integration-Ready Features- Use data attributes or placeholder callbacks (e.g., onCommentClick, onToggleReaction, onUserSwitch) so later you can hook up Velt SDK features: - Commenting (Figma-style or popover)—Velt supports this out of the box :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. - Reactions engine placeholders. - User presence cursors, user switcher.- Ensure comments & reactions have identifiable DOM structures or data-velt-target-* attributes ready for Velt injection :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.- Provide empty container elements (e.g. <div id="velt-comment-stream"></div>) where Velt can mount.- Mock data placeholders (cards, comments, users) are fine—logic to fetch and mutate will come later.## Tech & Style- Build using your preferred UI framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).- Use CSS variables or theming solution for dark/light mode.- Avoid heavy UI libraries—keep it minimal and easy to customize.---Goal: Deliver a UI skeleton for a collaborative task board that looks and behaves beautifully, with clear spots marked to plug in Velt-powered collaboration later.
